	<p>
		I'm a software engineer with over 15 years of experience building scalable, high-performance systems.
		My background is in PHP, but in recent years I’ve shifted much of my focus to C++ and, particularly, Rust - a language that matches
		my obsession with safety, performance, and software quality.
	</p>

	<p>
		Alongside my professional work, I’ve created <a href="https://cplusplus.es">cplusplus.es</a> to teach C++ from a
		modern perspective, and <a href="https://rustaceo.es">rustaceo.es</a>, a collection of practical notes
		that form a full Rust course in Spanish. These projects are part of a broader mission: to make
		professional-grade knowledge accessible to curious and ambitious developers.
	</p>

	<p>
		I care deeply about writing clean, maintainable code, and designing systems that are built to last.
		My approach is grounded in solid principles, careful testing, and the belief that craftsmanship
		matters at every level of the stack.
	</p>

	<p>
		Outside of coding, I enjoy exploring the boundary between systems design and human experience - whether
		that’s through developer tooling, educational writing, or building side projects that solve real-world problems.
	</p>

	<p>
		If you’re interested in trading systems, systems programming, or the design of modern developer platforms,
		you’ll probably find something interesting in my current work. Feel free to reach out or explore the site.
