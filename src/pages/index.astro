      <p>
        This site is built with <a href="https://astro.build/">Astro</a>, a modern framework for building fast, content-focused websites.
      </p>
      <p>
        Whether you're here for technical deep-dives, architecture discussions, or professional updates, you're in the right place.
      </p>
      <p>What youâ€™ll find here:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Well-structured articles covering software engineering, systems design, and development tools</li>
        <li>Project updates and open source contributions</li>
        <li>Learning resources and curated recommendations</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        The layout is minimal by design, allowing the content to take center stage. As the project evolves, so will this site.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you're building with Astro too, consider exploring the official
        <a href="https://docs.astro.build/">documentation</a> or visiting the <a href="https://astro.build/chat">community Discord</a>.
