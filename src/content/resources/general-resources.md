Johnson's book bridges the gap between theory and practice, focusing on the mechanics of direct market access and algorithmic execution. The coverage of order routing, market impact models, and execution algorithms is particularly relevant for HFT system architects.

## Mastering Rust for systems programming

### Rust fundamentals

**"Programming Rust: Fast, Safe Systems Development" by Jim Blandy, Jason Orendorff, Leonora Tindall (2nd Edition)**

The second edition of Programming Rust has evolved into the definitive systems programming guide for Rust. What sets this book apart for HFT developers is its focus on performance characteristics and memory management. The authors demonstrate how Rust's ownership system enables both safety and speed, with practical examples of concurrent programming patterns essential for trading systems.

**"The Rust Programming Language" (The Rust Book)**

Available free at https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/book/, the official Rust book remains the best starting point for newcomers. The online format means it's always up-to-date with the latest language features, and the progressive structure makes it accessible even for developers new to systems programming.

### Performance optimization in Rust

**"The Rust Performance Book" by Nicholas Nethercote**

This free online resource (https://nnethercote.github.io/perf-book/) has become the go-to reference for Rust performance optimization. Nethercote, a Mozilla developer with deep performance expertise, covers profiling techniques, memory optimization, and algorithmic improvements with real-world examples from Firefox development. For HFT developers, the sections on heap allocation, CPU efficiency, and compile-time optimization are particularly valuable.

**"Rust High Performance" (O'Reilly)**

This book teaches optimization techniques that can bring Rust performance to C/C++ levels. The coverage of metaprogramming for performance and concurrent execution patterns directly applies to HFT scenarios where every nanosecond matters.

**"Rust in Action" by Tim McNamara**

McNamara's practical approach to systems programming covers real-world scenarios including file I/O, networking, and operating system interfaces. The hands-on examples help bridge the gap between Rust language features and actual system implementation.

## Systems programming mastery

### Low-level performance optimization

**"Systems Performance: Enterprise and the Cloud" by Brendan Gregg**

Gregg's comprehensive guide to performance analysis is essential reading for anyone building high-performance systems. The methodologies for identifying bottlenecks, the deep dives into CPU and memory subsystems, and the practical profiling techniques apply directly to HFT system optimization. The book's focus on observability is particularly relevant as trading systems require extensive monitoring.

**"Computer Systems: A Programmer's Perspective" by Bryant & O'Hallaron**

This academic text provides the hardware understanding necessary for writing truly optimized code. The coverage of memory hierarchy, CPU architecture, and assembly language helps HFT developers understand the underlying costs of different programming choices. The sections on caching and memory optimization are particularly relevant.

**"What Every Programmer Should Know About Memory" by Ulrich Drepper**

Drepper's detailed treatment of memory systems is crucial for HFT developers who need to minimize cache misses and optimize memory access patterns. Understanding NUMA architectures, cache hierarchies, and memory bandwidth limitations directly impacts trading system performance.
