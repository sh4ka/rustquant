2. **Statistical Performance Analysis** - Interpreting latency distributions and detecting performance regressions
3. **Systems Programming** - Low-level optimization and measurement infrastructure
4. **Trading Domain Knowledge** - Understanding what to measure and why it matters
5. **Measurement Science** - Avoiding observer effects and ensuring benchmark validity
