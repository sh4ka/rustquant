This project is not just about code. It’s a structured journey into the world of trading systems, with a strong focus on high-frequency trading (HFT), system design, and code quality. We’ll build an open-source framework in Rust that reflects the practices of production-grade software: modular, testable, observable, and fast.

Rust is an ideal tool for this purpose. It offers control over performance without compromising safety, and allows us to express low-latency architectures in a way that’s explicit and reliable.

Our goal is to learn by building. This includes a professional library for trading in Rust, and a set of articles that teach, explain, and reflect on every major concept and design decision.

---

## The vision

We aim to create:

* A learning resource for engineers who want to go deep into HFT and low-latency trading.
* A modular Rust library that abstracts common trading components (market data, execution, strategy logic, risk management).
* A series of articles that show, step by step, how to build, measure, and reason about every part of a trading system.
* A professional-grade architecture that can serve as a base for real-world experimentation.

This is not a toy project. From the start, we’ll use good engineering practices: benchmarks, CI, abstractions with clear boundaries, latency metrics, logging, and thoughtful design patterns.

---

## The roadmap

The journey is structured in five stages. Each one brings new components, new design constraints, and new opportunities to optimize.

### 1. Foundations

**Objective:** set up our environment and understand the basics of market mechanics.

Topics:

* Market structure: what is a limit order book? what does it mean to be a market maker or a taker?
* Basic order types, spread, depth, latency.
* Installing Rust and preparing the system for low-latency workloads.
* Picking an async runtime (or going fully sync), performance benchmarking with `criterion`, building flamegraphs.

Deliverables:

* A toy exchange simulator with a naive matching engine.
* Project layout with workspaces, logging, config handling, and basic tests.

---

### 2. Market data ingestion

**Objective:** build a fast and modular market data feed processor.

Topics:

* How to receive data from exchanges: WebSocket, REST, UDP, or FIX.
* Efficient JSON/Protobuf decoding.
* Ring buffers and lock-free queues for ingestion.
* Designing a clean feed abstraction to allow real/simulated data interchangeably.

Deliverables:

* A `market_data` crate with multiple feed types and a performance benchmark suite.

---

### 3. Strategy engine

**Objective:** create a strategy engine that works both in simulation and live environments.

Topics:

* Event-driven architecture and trait-based strategies.
* Managing state: snapshots, time series, internal caches.
* Testing strategies offline: input recording, replay systems, property-based testing.

Deliverables:

* A `strategy_engine` crate with basic built-in strategies (e.g. VWAP, momentum).
* A simulation harness to run strategies offline on recorded data.

---

### 4. Order execution and risk

**Objective:** send orders safely, track their status, and handle rejection, risk, and reconciliation.

Topics:

* Design of an execution API: sync vs async, traits vs channels.
* Sending to real or simulated exchanges.
* Risk management hooks: position size, exposure, cancel-on-disconnect, kill-switch logic.

Deliverables:

* An `execution` crate that abstracts exchange interaction.
* Risk controls embedded in the order flow.

---

### 5. Infrastructure and operations

**Objective:** make the system observable and production-ready.

Topics:

* Metrics with `tracing`, Prometheus, and histogram-based latency measurement.
* Configuration management and error handling.
* Docker setup, simulation runners, and dashboards.

Deliverables:

* A full containerized version of the system with monitoring tools.
* Real-time metrics dashboard and structured logs.

## Design principles

Throughout the project we will follow a few core ideas:

* **Performance matters**: we’ll profile early and often.
* **Clean boundaries**: each component will be abstracted in its own crate.
* **Testability**: everything can be simulated, tested, and mocked.
* **Observability**: logs and metrics are part of the design, not an afterthought.
* **Code quality**: even in high-performance systems, correctness comes first.

---

## Who is this for?

This project is written for engineers who:

* Are interested in algorithmic and quantitative trading.
* Want to learn HFT system architecture by building from scratch.
* Already know Rust and want to apply it to a challenging, real-world domain.
* Care about software quality, clean design, and performance.

## Next steps

The next article will walk through the technical setup: how to structure the project, how to write a simple market simulator, and how to prepare for the challenges ahead.

This is the beginning of a long journey. We’ll keep the code clean, the benchmarks honest, and the lessons practical.
