# Rust HFT Framework (To-Do)

> A high-performance, extensible trading library for building ultra-low-latency systems in Rust.

## ðŸš€ Overview

**Rust HFT Framework** is an open-source initiative to develop a robust, production-ready library for algorithmic and high-frequency trading, entirely written in [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/). It combines the safety and performance of Rust with trading-specific abstractions to serve as both a learning platform and a professional toolset.

This repository also includes a growing collection of educational articles and examples to support those who want to learn HFT concepts while building practical systems in Rust.

## ðŸ“š Features

- Modular, extensible architecture for custom trading strategies
- Market data feed handlers (planned: FIX, WebSocket, UDP)
- Low-latency event loop and task scheduling
- Order management subsystem
- Risk control and position tracking
- Real-time metrics and monitoring
- Plug-in support for backtesting and simulation
