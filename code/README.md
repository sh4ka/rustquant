# HFT Framework Code Directory

This directory is reserved for future code implementations that will be developed as part of the HFT framework blog series.

## Purpose

As we progress through the different phases of the HFT framework development documented in the blog articles, the corresponding Rust code implementations will be placed here for readers to follow along with the practical examples.

## Planned Structure

```
code/
├── phase-1/           # Core infrastructure and benchmarking (Future)
├── phase-2/           # Market data ingestion (Future)
├── phase-3/           # Trading engine (Future)
├── phase-4/           # Risk management (Future)
├── phase-5/           # Production systems (Future)
└── examples/          # Standalone examples from articles (Future)
```

## Development Approach

Code will be added incrementally as each phase is completed and the corresponding blog articles are published. Each implementation will include:

- Complete working code examples
- Comprehensive benchmarks and tests
- Performance validation
- Documentation aligned with the blog content

This ensures readers can follow the practical implementation alongside the theoretical concepts explained in the articles.

## Current Status

**Phase 1**: Planned - Core infrastructure and nanosecond benchmarking
- Workspace setup and fundamental types
- High-precision timing and statistical analysis  
- Custom allocators and lock-free data structures
- Performance tests and validation

## Stay Tuned

Check back here as we progress through each phase of the HFT framework development. The code implementations will directly support and demonstrate the concepts explained in the blog series.
